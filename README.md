# Linear Regression Project

This repository contains a linear regression implementation to predict restaurant profits based on city population.

## Files

- `W2A1.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with the linear regression implementation.
- `utils.py`: Helper functions for the project.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/regmibhuwan/city-population-profit-predictor.git

2. Install necessary packages:
